This web application was developed by Nick J. Petrone and Luis Cruz Sanchez as part of the Washington Vets to Tech (WaV2T) program. We developed application over the course of a few weeks utilizing the Django framework, gaining significant insights into web application development in the process.

Luis took the lead on the front-end, implementing the 3D-model display, cart functionality, and most of the theming. Meanwhile, Nick focused on the back-end, handling user accounts, authentication, and profile functionalities.
